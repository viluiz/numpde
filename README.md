# Numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using PyTorch

## Files:

- **Poisson_equation_finite_differences**: Finite difference solution of the Poisson equation (elliptic equation).
- **Diffusion_equation_finite_differences**:  Finite difference solution of the heat/diffusion equation (parabolic equation).
- **Advection_equation_finite_differences**: Finite difference solution of the transport/advection equation (hyperbolic equation).
- **Advection_Diffusion_equation_finite_differences**: Finite difference solution of the Advection/Convection-Diffusion equation (combines parabolic and hyperbolic equations).
- **Burgers_non-conservative_equation_finite_differences**: Finite difference solution of the Burgers equation (nonloinear hyperbolic equation) \*\*\*the non-conservative form cannot represent the evolution of the shock properly.
- **compare_numpy_pytorch.xlsx**: Runtime comparison betwwen NumPy and PyTorch implementation.
